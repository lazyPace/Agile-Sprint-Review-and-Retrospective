## Reflection

### How do interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
User stories define how sodtware should respond in specific scenarios, keeping the user's perspective central and reducing errors during development. They act as a guide that keeps the team aligned on what truly matters to the end user.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incoroporate into my future development work?
I see programs as systems of interconnected parts, and Agile practices like incremental development and feedback loops keeps progress focused and adaptable. This approach ensures that even complex work evolves in a steady and manageable way.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in a software development team is both adaptable and clear in communication, sharing ideas in ways that help the entire team move forward together. Success comes from collaboration, not just individual contributors.
